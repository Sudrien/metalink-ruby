# metalink-ruby

Class to format Metalink 4 / rfc5854 / .meta4 XML

No code taken from timsjoberg/metalink-ruby


All rfc5854 metadata in the process of being supported. Only supporting sha-256, as reccomended by the spec - so no configuration options there.


Future development:
* usage samples
* "metalink:pieces" support - with configurable piece size/count if possible
* more passed-in data validation.
